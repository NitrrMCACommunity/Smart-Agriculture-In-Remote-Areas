# Smart-Agriculture-In-Remote-Areas
There are many IoT system in agriculture domain and they are helping the farmers to make complex decisions about crops and reducing the human efforts. But in India there are many remote places where internet facility is not available, due to lack of internet of facility fields data cannot be send to cloud server for analysis. So IoT based agriculture seems difficult in remote areas so this system basically developed to apply IoT in remote areas.  This system uses the concept of drones to collect the data from the fields and send it to the cloud server for analysis. Cloud server will analyze this fieldâ€™s data using machine learning techniques and farmer will get predictions and decisions along with the data on android application.
